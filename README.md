### Hi there!

I'm **Don Schnitzius**, a freelance remote designer, developer, and teacher from Chicago. I design and build beautiful interfaces for apps and websites.

When I'm not slinging pixels and code, I love making music in Logic Pro, and using Blender to build 3D models of brutalist and mid-century modern furniture and architecture from found photos.

**Languages and Tools:**

- HTML, CSS, JS, PHP
- React, NodeJS, Python
- Xcode, Android Studio, Ionic
- WordPress, Joomla
- Sketch, Figma, Photoshop
- Illustrator, InDesign, After Effects
