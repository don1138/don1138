### Hi there!

I'm Don Schnitzius, a freelance remote designer, developer, and teacher from Chicago. I design 📐 and build 🛠 beautiful interfaces for apps 📱 and websites 🖥.

When I'm not designing interfaces or writing code, I love to make music in Logic Pro and use Blender to build 3D models based on found photos of brutalist and mid-century modern furniture and architecture.

**Languages and Tools:**

HTML/CSS/JS/PHP | React/NodeJS/Python | Sketch/Figma/Photoshop | WordPress/Joomla | Illustrator/InDesign/After Effects
